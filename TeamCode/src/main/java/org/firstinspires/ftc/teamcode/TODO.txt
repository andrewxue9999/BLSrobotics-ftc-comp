Drivetrain:
1. Ask Kyle about swerve input lag
2. leftFront and leftBack swapping issue?
3. each crservo gets its own individual PID constants (to help address individual oscillation issues)

Vision:
1. Set Up Limelight on Control Hub: https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/FTC/setup
2. Set Up Limelight Apriltag Pipeline: https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/FTC/pipelines
3. Crosshair Calibration: https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/crosshair
4. ChArUco Camera Calibration?: https://docs.limelightvision.io/docs/docs-limelight/getting-started/performing-charuco-camera-calibration
5. Print physical AprilTags for testing with VisionHardwareSetup.java on Tuesday ("Enable "Full 3D" in your AprilTag pipeline's "Advanced" tab in the web interface. Use the web interface to position your camera relative to the center of your robot's footprint.")
6. Integrate Vision.java into Teleop.java once the hardware is set up
7. add IMU

Localization:
1. Look at logic of this (implement it but for visual localization instead): https://github.com/KookyBotz/PowerPlay/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode/common/drive/localizer

Auto:
1. Implement basic Roadrunner thing that literally just parks, since that's all we're doing for the upcoming scrimmage apparently
